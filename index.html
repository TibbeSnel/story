Dispite trying to do good, your work is technically illegal because you and W@tson work independent, and not for any government or agency.The consequence is that no one can know who you are, and fortunately no one does, or so you think... \n\nOne day a strange man approaches you, he is wearing a long brown overcoat and a hat with the same colour. He stops and says: 'Hello $herlock, Lovely day isn't it?' 'How do you know my codename?!' That's besides the point, I am an MI6 agent and I am here to ask you for help...' \n\n'An hacker calling herself Ghost hacked the biggest Nuclear Launching Site in Brittain...' $herlock responds: 'What?! Ghost?! The whole world is in danger! She is the most dangerous hacker in the world!' The agent procedes: 'Yes, we know, and all of MI6 MI5 and GCHQ are working on it, but you're the only one who knows Ghost, you've even worked with her.' $herlock cuts him off: 'So you want to ask me to stop her?'

What do you think? \n\nOption A: You say: 'That is true, but I think the  agency's can solve it themselves. and more importantly: I don't want to die!'\n\nOption B: You say 'That is exactly what I was already planning, let's find her and stop her before it's to late!'";
